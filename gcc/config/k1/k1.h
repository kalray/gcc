/* A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
   class to use when it is necessary to copy value x into a register
   in class class. The value is a register class; perhaps class, or
   perhaps another, smaller class. On many machines, the following
   definition is safe:

   #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

   Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code. For
   example, on the 68000, when x is an integer  constant that is in
   range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is always
   DATA_REGS as long as class includes the data registers. Requiring a
   data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.

   One case where PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS must not return class is if x
   is a legitimate constant which cannot be loaded into some register
   class. By returning NO_REGS you can force x into a memory
   location. For example, rs6000 can load immediate values into
   general-purpose registers, but does not have an instruction for
   loading an immediate value into a floating-point register, so
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS returns NO_REGS when x is a floating-point
   constant. If the constant can't be loaded into any kind of
   register, code generation will be better if LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P
   makes the constant illegitimate instead of using
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS.

   If an insn has pseudos in it after register allocation, reload will
   go through the alternatives and call repeatedly
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS to find the best one. Returning NO_REGS, in
   this case, makes reload add a ! in front of the constraint: the x86
   back-end uses this feature to discourage usage of 387 registers
   when math is done in the SSE registers (and vice versa). */

/* A C expression that indicates whether the architecture defines a
   value for clz or ctz with a zero operand. A result of 0 indicates
   the value is undefined. If the value is defined for only the RTL
   expression, the macro should evaluate to 1; if the value applies
   also to the corresponding optab entry (which is normally the case
   if it expands directly into the corresponding RTL), then the macro
   should evaluate to 2. In the cases where the value is defined,
   value should be set to this value.

   If this macro is not defined, the value of clz or ctz at zero is
   assumed to be undefined.

   This macro must be defined if the target's expansion for ffs relies
   on a particular value to get correct results. Otherwise it is not
   necessary, though it may be used to optimize some corner cases, and
   to provide a default expansion for the ffs optab.

   Note that regardless of this macro the “definedness” of clz and ctz
   at zero do not extend to the builtin functions visible to the
   user. Thus one may be free to adjust the value at will to match the
   target expansion of these operations without fear of breaking the
   API. */
