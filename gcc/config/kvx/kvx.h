/* A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
   class to use when it is necessary to copy value x into a register
   in class class. The value is a register class; perhaps class, or
   perhaps another, smaller class. On many machines, the following
   definition is safe:

   #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

   Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code. For
   example, on the 68000, when x is an integer  constant that is in
   range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is always
   DATA_REGS as long as class includes the data registers. Requiring a
   data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.

   One case where PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS must not return class is if x
   is a legitimate constant which cannot be loaded into some register
   class. By returning NO_REGS you can force x into a memory
   location. For example, rs6000 can load immediate values into
   general-purpose registers, but does not have an instruction for
   loading an immediate value into a floating-point register, so
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS returns NO_REGS when x is a floating-point
   constant. If the constant can't be loaded into any kind of
   register, code generation will be better if LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P
   makes the constant illegitimate instead of using
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS.

   If an insn has pseudos in it after register allocation, reload will
   go through the alternatives and call repeatedly
   PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS to find the best one. Returning NO_REGS, in
   this case, makes reload add a ! in front of the constraint: the x86
   back-end uses this feature to discourage usage of 387 registers
   when math is done in the SSE registers (and vice versa). */
